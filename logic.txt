Drawing Pieces:
- Shapes: L-shape, O, I, S, Z, J, T (all are four square units)
- One function per shape - coordinates should be dependent on one another

1. check key (4 for down, left, right, rotate) --> movement is always a unit of 20 pixels
2. based on key pressed, update temporary index variable (DO NOT change array or tetris block position yet)
3. check new coordinates    
    a. check with array, if arr[index - 1] == 1 (we hit the left border, stop moving left - do not update x )
    b. check with array, if arr[index + 1] == 1 (we hit the right border, stop moving right - do not update x)
    c. check with array, if arr[index ]
    d. check with bottom border (piece is placed, go to next piece)
